This step illustrates a property of text n-grams: any single sequence of length n can be decomposed into two overlapping sequences of length n-1. Thus we can decompose any arbitrarily long match into some number of overlapping trigrams, and conversely we can \"rebuild\" a match of any length by combining the trigrams we got in step 1."
